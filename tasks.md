# Anahata ASI Project Tasks

This file tracks the actionable tasks and tactical goals for the Anahata ASI (V2) project.

## 0. Zero Day Go Live: 
- [ ] make "cached data" in MediaView transient? possibly in text resources too?

- [] ContextPanel -> 
    - ResourcePanel shows the editors way below for Reformatter.java for example, may be related to resources that don't fit on the default viewport and the issue may occur after doing expand to fit viewport.

- [ ] change all log.info to log.debug

- [ ] enums in json schemas dont have description

- [ ] tool calls that use ObjectToStringParameterRenderer for all params have very tall tool call panel height like maven.runGoals

- [ ] AbstractTextResourceWriteRenderer fills logs with errors if resource not in context, which is a good point because if you update a file and take it out of context on the next turn, it can't do Resource.getName(). Check the null check i did on resource.

- [ ] WrapLayout from unload resources chips doesnt calculate horizontal width correctly, causes the adjustingTabPane to push the the toolcallpanels width to the point that you don't see the run button



## 1. Have to do before Go Live: 
- [ ] merge helders database branch
- [ ] chatgpt responses api and chat completions api with files, images, audio on responses and completions
- [ ] test one hf model with the chat completions api and put (Beta) 
- [ ] test minimax provider
- [ ] path parameter renderer in netbeans and resource param renderer?
    
## 2. Post Go Live (v1.1)
- [ ] **Investigate editTextResource Diff limitations**: Investigate why in `editTextResource` we cannot edit the right-hand side of the diff or do cherry-picking.
- [ ] **[CORE] Generic "TOO LARGE" Response Handling**: Implement a mechanism to detect when a `JavaMethodToolResponse` (including logs, errors, and result) exceeds a safe token/size threshold. If too large, the status should be set to `TOO_LARGE` and the content truncated or replaced with a summary to prevent context window exhaustion.
- [x] Error highlighting and code folds on diff viewer and java tool
- [ ] Rework system instructions to be more natural
- [ ] **ContextPanel**: Still some flickers when i have a node selected in the tree and a resource changes or a message arrives the right hand side disappears
- [x] **ContextPanel Message / part Details**: The messages are not like in the conversation view, the have a massive horizontal scrollbar, see if in the part viewer we can force it to show expanded without changing the expanded attribute on the model

- [x] **ATRV Height Calculation**: Add `public abstract AgiPanel getAgiPanel(Agi)` to `AbstractSwingAsiContainer` to enable hot-reloading tests for the `NetBeansTextResourceViewer` preferred height math.
- [x] **Resources Toolkit**: Add `unloadResourcesByUri(List<String> uris)` and `setProviding(List<String> uuids, boolean providing)`.
- [x] **Log Monitoring Popup**: Refactor `IDE.monitorLogs` to use `PathHandle` to bypass the NetBeans VFS and suppress the "File modified externally" dialog.
- [x] **URI/UUID Renderers**: Split into `UriParameterRenderer` and `ResourceUUIDParameterRenderer` in the core swing module. Update to generically accept `Object` and parse Lists safely without `ClassCastException`.
- [x] **Editor Shortcuts**: Fix `Ctrl+Z` (UndoManager binding to ancestor) and implement `Ctrl+S` (Save & Continue).

- [ ] **NetBeans Local History File System Integration **:
    - [ ] Local History integration via change messages.
    - [ ] Version Control with line numbers (text based glyph gutter)

- [ ] See what it would take to do the "add / remove to AGI Context for "files in a jar"
- [ ] Metabollic Donut Chart with click in to expand any section to an inner donut chart 
- [ ] **Next-Gen Project Overview/Structure**: 
    Explore UML-like structural representations for Project Structure or including the TreePathHandle or a short version of the extends and implements clauses like e Throwable i so you can include what extends and what implements along with the class level types, check token costs
    Include maven phases similar to mavne action runner nb plugin

- [ ] **Hierarchical Agent Management**:
    - [ ] **Subagent API**: Improve API for the model to spawn subagents with 
            - fine-grained control over `AgiConfig` `RequestConfig` and Tool permissions, 
            - something to approve pending tool calls as well and to simply send messages as the user or a sendContext
            - get the full details of any part or message
            - get the consolidated metadata index or always include it in the rag message of the parent
    - [ ] **Reporting Mechanism**: Implement a way for subagents to report task completion and results back to the "Boss" agent via shared dashboard or messaging system or something like that.
    

## 3. Post Go Live Go Live (v1.2)
- [ ] **CwQL**: Create a Context Window Query Language spec and implementation. So if the model spawans subagents or wants to peek into saved or disposed sessions. A simple query language can be used like 
        - sessionUUID/history(role=model)/partType=text/thought=false 
        - sessionUUID/tools/RadioTool/selectedPlaybackDevice (to look up the selectedPlaybackDevice field in the RadioTool) 
        - sessionUUID/status or sessionUUID/history/size 
        - disposed/sessionUUID/history/role=model/(matching:'Task completed')
        - remoteContaier/*(all sessions)/history/role=model/(matching:'Task completed')
        - or anything that would allow the ASI to surgically check what other agents are doing or what is in the saved or dispossed sessions dir (infinte memory)
